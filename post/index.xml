      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I have been organising the team&amp;rsquo;s Brown Bag events since last year, we send out an html email every week to let the team know what&amp;rsquo;s happening. The html email have never been easy to keep a consistent style across all platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The macOS Outlook and the built in Mail has always been very friendly towards html emails. Problems&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After having tried out several static site engines and hosting solutions. I&amp;rsquo;ve finally started writing my first blog. Yeah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What to write about? I guess everything about my life maybe food or travel? I would probably write a little about technologies although I am really not a guru. I enjoy exploring new technologies and I can spend my whole weekend in my uni library, play with some cool stuff, say, Elasticsearch stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having been in the UK for 2 years and really enjoying living and working here. I found the food is really not too bad. Three of my favourites: sausage rolls, Yorkshire puddings and victoria sponge cakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, guess that is so much for today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until next time,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xiao&lt;/p&gt;
